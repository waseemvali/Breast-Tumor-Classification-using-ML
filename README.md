Breast Tumor Diagnosis using KNN, Logistic Regression and Random Forests and optimization

## About the data set
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

## Method used for classification 

- KNN
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
